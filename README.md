# TimeCapsule: Unveiling Your Birthday Wonders

## Description
-The goal of this app is to be fun and functional
-In learning new skills we wanted to make something our friends would be excited to test drive as well!
-It is built to display facts about the birthday of the user (top headline of the day, book of the year, and or movie of the year)
-When the user opens the modal, enters their birthdate, and chooses a category
-Then our site displays cards that contain the facts from the day the user chose
-Each category has it's own card
-This was our first time working in a group this semester
-So there was a lot to learn about collaboration and Github merging
-And also the genuine joys of sharing the workload
