# TimeCapsule: Unveiling Your Birthday Wonders <br>

## Description <br>
- The goal of this app is to be fun and functional 
- In learning new skills we wanted to make something our friends would be excited to try out, too. 
- It is built to display facts about the birthdate of the user (top headline of the day, book of the year, and/or movie of the year) 
- When the user opens the modal, enters their birthdate, and chooses a category 
- Then our site displays cards that contain the facts from the day the user chose 
- Each category has it's own card 
- This was our first time working in a group this semester 
- So there was a lot to learn about collaboration and Github merging 
- And also the genuine joys of sharing the workload
